# STST Stock Prediction

## Description

This project implements a spatiotemporal time series prediction model for stock market data using the STST architecture. It leverages temporal embeddings generated by the Date2Vec model and technical indicators for feature engineering.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
   cd STST_StockPrediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Configure the parameters in the main script `stst.py`.
2. Start the training:
   ```bash
   python stst.py
   ```

Data is preprocess using `feature_engineering.py`:
   ```bash
   python feature_engineering.py
   ```
   This script processes raw stock data into a format suitable for training by:
   - Filtering data by date range.
   - Generating scaled time-based features (e.g., year, month, day).
   - Computing technical indicators (e.g., SMA, EMA, MACD, RSI).
   - Creating binary signals and labels for supervised learning.

### Temporal Encoding with Date2Vec

The Date2Vec model is used to generate temporal embeddings. You can use a pre-trained model or train a new one by following the instructions in the `Date2Vec` folder.
